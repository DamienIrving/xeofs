	abstract = {Climate and weather constitute a typical example where high dimensional and complex phenomena meet. The atmospheric system is the result of highly complex interactions between many degrees of freedom or modes. In order to gain insight in understanding the dynamical/physical behaviour involved it is useful to attempt to understand their interactions in terms of a much smaller number of prominent modes of variability. This has led to the development by atmospheric researchers of methods that give a space display and a time display of large space-time atmospheric data. Empirical orthogonal functions ({EOFs}) were first used in meteorology in the late 1940s. The method, which decomposes a space-time field into spatial patterns and associated time indices, contributed much in advancing our knowledge of the atmosphere. However, since the atmosphere contains all sorts of features, e.g. stationary and propagating, {EOFs} are unable to provide a full picture. For example, {EOFs} tend, in general, to be difficult to interpret because of their geometric properties, such as their global feature, and their orthogonality in space and time. To obtain more localised features, modifications, e.g. rotated {EOFs} ({REOFs}), have been introduced. At the same time, because these methods cannot deal with propagating features, since they only use spatial correlation of the field, it was necessary to use both spatial and time information in order to identify such features. Extended and complex {EOFs} were introduced to serve that purpose. Because of the importance of {EOFs} and closely related methods in atmospheric science, and because the existing reviews of the subject are slightly out of date, there seems to be a need to update our knowledge by including new developments that could not be presented in previous reviews. This review proposes to achieve precisely this goal. The basic theory of the main types of {EOFs} is reviewed, and a wide range of applications using various data sets are also provided.

	title = {Rotated spectral principal component analysis ({rsPCA}) for identifying dynamical modes of variability in climate systems},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11411},
	abstract = {Spectral {PCA} ({sPCA}), in contrast to classical {PCA}, offers the advantage of identifying organized spatiotemporal patterns within speciﬁc frequency bands and extracting dynamical modes. However, the unavoidable tradeoff between frequency resolution and robustness of the {PCs} leads to high sensitivity to noise and overﬁtting, which limits the interpretation of the {sPCA} results. We propose herein a simple non-parametric implementation of the {sPCA} using the continuous analytic Morlet wavelet as a robust estimator of the cross-spectral matrices with good frequency resolution. To improve the interpretability of the results when several modes of similar amplitude exist within the same frequency band, we propose a rotation of eigenvectors that optimizes the spatial smoothness in the phase domain. The developed method, called rotated spectral {PCA} ({rsPCA}), is tested on synthetic data simulating propagating waves and shows impressive performance even with high levels of noise in the data. Applied to historical sea surface temperature ({SST}) time series over the Paciﬁc Ocean, the method accurately captures the El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) at low frequency (2 to 7 years periodicity). At high frequencies (sub-annual periodicity), at which several extratropical patterns of similar amplitude are identiﬁed, the {rsPCA} successfully unmixes the underlying modes, revealing spatially coherent patterns with robust propagation dynamics. Identiﬁcation of higher frequency space-time climate modes holds promise for seasonal to subseasonal prediction and for diagnostic analysis of climate models.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing observations, products and simulations are fundamental sources of information to monitor our planet and its climate variability. Uncovering the main modes of spatial and temporal variability in Earth data is essential to analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics and processes driving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with spatio-temporal datasets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), also known as Empirical Orthogonal Functions ({EOF}) in geophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze climatic data. However, when nonlinear feature relations are present, {PCA}/{EOF} fails. In this work, we propose a nonlinear {PCA} method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth System data. The proposed method, called Rotated Complex Kernel {PCA} ({ROCK}-{PCA} for short), works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes, operates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space and time features, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an explicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The method is unsupervised and computationally very efficient.We illustrate its ability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns using synthetic experiments and real data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate variables are shown: satellite-based global Gross Primary Productivity ({GPP}) and Soil Moisture ({SM}), and reanalysis Sea Surface Temperature ({SST}) data. The {ROCK}-{PCA} method allows identifying their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as their non-seasonal trends and spatial variability patterns.},
