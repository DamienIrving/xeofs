        "\n# Complex/Hilbert EOF analysis\n\nWe demonstrate how to execute a Complex EOF (or Hilbert EOF) analysis [1]_ [2]_ [3]_. \nThis method extends traditional EOF analysis into the complex domain, allowing \nthe EOF components to have real and imaginary parts. This capability can reveal\noscillatory patterns in datasets, which are common in Earth observations. \nFor example, beyond typical examples like seasonal cycles, you can think of\ninternal waves in the ocean, or the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation in the atmosphere.\n\nUsing monthly sea surface temperature data from 1970 to 2021 as an example, we \nhighlight the method's key features and address edge effects as a common challenge.\n\n..

While showing some similarity to\nENSO (e.g. in mode 3 peaks in 1982, 1998 and 2016), they exhibit a \"running away\"\nbehaviour towards the boundaries of the time series.\nThis a common issue in complex EOF analysis which is based on the Hilbert transform (a convolution)\nthat suffers from the absence of information at the time series boundaries. One way to mitigate this\nis to artificially extend the time series also known as *padding*. In ``xeofs``, you can enable\nsuch a padding by setting the ``padding`` parameter to ``\"exp\"`` which will extent the boundaries by an exponential\ndecaying function. The ``decay_factor`` parameter controls the decay rate of the exponential function measured in\nmultiples of the time series length. Let's see how the decay parameter impacts the results:\n\n"
