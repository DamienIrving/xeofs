Core Models
-----------------

The supported models in ``xeofs`` currently include:

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::  EOF Analysis
      :link: model_pca
      :link-type: doc


      Unveils dominant patterns of variabililty in your data.

    .. grid-item-card::  Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA)
      :link: api_core_methods
      :link-type: doc

      Uncovers co-varying patterns between two sets of data.


Enhanced Interpretability
---------------------------

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::  Varimax Rotation
      :link: api_rotation
      :link-type: doc

      Breaks orthogonal constrain for easier interpretation. 

    .. grid-item-card::  Promax Rotation
      :link: api_rotation
      :link-type: doc

      Allow oblique rotation to identify correlated patterns.


Advanced Techniques
--------------------

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::  Complex/Hilbert Extensions
      :link: api_advanced_techniques
      :link-type: doc

      Identify oscillatory patterns in your data. 



Model Validation
--------------------

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::  Bootstrapper
      :link: api_validation
      :link-type: doc

      Bootstrap your model to assess its robustness.
