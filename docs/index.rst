Advanced EOF Analysis in Python
#############################################################
|
``xeofs`` is a toolbox designed to handle multi-dimensional EOF analysis and related methods
for Earth system sciences, leveraging the power of packages like ``xarray`` for 
labeled, multi-dimensional analysis and 
``dask`` for scalability. It supports various forms of 
EOF analysis including standard, rotated, and multivariate analysis. 
The overall goal of ``xeofs`` is to unify and extend existing EOF implementations, 
thereby enhancing their application in the broader scientific community.
